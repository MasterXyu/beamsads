Beams Ads
========

This repo contains scripts to do an initial implementation of ad display for Roscoe.TV. A simple mock-up version of the website's pages in HTML and CSS is also included here for the sake of demo and testing of how the scripts work. 

Features of the prototype:

- Built in jQuery 2.0.

- Displays an interstitial full-page ad upon initial site visit by a visitor to any page. 

- Displays a clickable ad/sponsor message on playback pages for individual news stories.

- Employs Google Analytics to track ad views and ad click-throughs for one site sponsor per week.

There are no known issues with the software at this time, but it does require a server with PHP installed, in order to render the single-story display pages correctly.

Code from this project should be ready to deploy quickly once we close sale of an actual ad. Just to be safe, it's recommended that when the time comes, we begin moving code over 48-72 hours **before** first sponsor's ad is due to begin displaying. That will leave ample time to do any last-minute troubleshooting, even if sponsor gets a small amount of "freebie" display time. -pm
